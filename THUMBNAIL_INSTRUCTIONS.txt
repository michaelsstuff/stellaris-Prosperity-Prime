To complete the mod, you need to create a thumbnail.png file:

1. Create a 128x128 pixel image representing your OP Start System
2. The image should ideally show a star with multiple planets to represent your powerful starting system
3. Add visual elements that indicate resources or power
4. Save it as "thumbnail.png" in this directory (next to this text file)
5. The image will appear in the mod launcher when properly placed

Suggested elements to include:
- A bright yellow/orange G-class star (Solar Prime)
- Multiple planets of different colors (representing the various planet types)
- Sparkles or glowing elements to represent resources
- Visual indicators of prosperity and abundance

Once you've created the thumbnail, you can delete this instruction file.
