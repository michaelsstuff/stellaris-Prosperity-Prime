# OP Start System - Prosperity Prime

A Stellaris mod that provides an overpowered starting system optimized for Stellaris 4.0 Phoenix Update's new zone specialization system.

## Features

### **The "Prosperity Prime" System**
- **Large Homeworld**: "New Eden" (Size 25) - Your main starting planet with massive potential
- **Specialized Moons**: 3 perfectly positioned moons (Size 12 each) with powerful specialization bonuses:
  - **Energy Prime** - Energy production powerhouse (+50% technician output, +5 generator districts, +3 technician jobs)
  - **Minerals Core** - Mining specialist world (+50% miner output, +5 mining districts, +3 miner jobs)  
  - **Farming Haven** - Agricultural center (+50% farmer output, +5 farming districts, +3 farmer jobs)
- **Paradise World**: "Paradise World" (Size 20) - Research-focused planet with +15% researcher output
- **Strategic Resource Planets**:

  - **Gas Harvester** (Size 30) - Exotic Gases production
- **Resource-Rich Asteroid Belt** - Auto-generates asteroids with valuable resources
- **Bonus Barren World** - Mixed resource deposits for early mining stations

### **Phoenix 4.0 Compatibility**
