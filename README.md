# OP Start System

A Stellaris mod that adds a new overpowered starting system for Stellaris 4.0.

## Features

- Custom solar system with 5 large, highly habitable planets
- G-class star "Solar Prime" with a 25-tile homeworld "New Eden"  
- **Four additional colonies** all size 18-20 and perfectly suited to your species:
  - **Energy Prime** (Size 18) - Perfect for energy district specialization
  - **Minerals Core** (Size 18) - Ideal for mining operations
  - **Farming Haven** (Size 18) - Great for agricultural development
  - **Paradise World** (Size 20) - Balanced world for research and industry
- All planets use `ideal_planet_class` ensuring maximum habitability for any species
- **Large planet advantage**: Having multiple size 18-20 planets provides massive early-game advantage
- Selectable in the game start menu via game rules
- **Stellaris 4.0 Phoenix Update Compatible** - Works with the new district and zone system

## How It Works

2. **Perfect Habitability**: All planets will be 100% habitable for your species  
3. **No Travel Distance**: All colonies are in your home system for instant colonization
4. **Zone System Compatibility**: Works perfectly with Stellaris 4.0's new district specialization system
5. **Early Expansion**: No need to search for habitable planets - just colonize what's already there
6. **Flexible Development**: Use the zone system to specialize planets however you want
